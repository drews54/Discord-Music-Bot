## Reporting a Vulnerability

Place an issue **tagging the affected feature's code** according to `GitHub guidelines` and, if necessary, **providing a screenshot**.  
Issues that **do not describe the vulnerability** in a sufficient way *to find its source* (no tags, links or screenshots) will be **closed**.

Whenever the uni isn't too heavy on us, me and/or @piunov1998 will respond *ASAP*.

If resolving the vulnerability is within our capabilities, we'll do what we can.  
If not â€“ I'll make a quick patch to work around the affected feature until the issue's resolved.
